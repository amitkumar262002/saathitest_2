> Ensure a function is only called once

When called multiple times it will return the return value from the first call.

*Unlike the module [once](https://github.com/isaacs/once), this one isn't naughty and extending `Function.prototype`.*

## Install

```
$ npm install onetime
```

## Usage

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
import onetime from 'onetime';

let index = 0;

const foo = onetime(() => ++index);
=======
const onetime = require('onetime');

let i = 0;

const foo = onetime(() => ++i);
>>>>>>> a1e0db2c (first commit)

foo(); //=> 1
foo(); //=> 1
foo(); //=> 1

onetime.callCount(foo); //=> 3
```

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
import onetime from 'onetime';
=======
const onetime = require('onetime');
>>>>>>> a1e0db2c (first commit)

const foo = onetime(() => {}, {throw: true});

foo();

foo();
//=> Error: Function `foo` can only be called once
```
