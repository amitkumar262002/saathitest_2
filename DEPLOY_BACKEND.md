# How to Deploy Backend Server for Real User Connections

## The Problem
Currently, your app runs in "Demo Mode" on GitHub Pages because there's no backend server. This means users see a simulated video chat experience, not real connections with other users.

## Solution: Deploy a Backend Server

To connect with actual users, you need to deploy the backend server to a platform that supports Node.js and WebSockets.

## Option 1: Deploy to Railway (Recommended - Easy & Free)

### Steps:

1. **Sign up for Railway**: https://railway.app/
   - Sign up with your GitHub account (free tier available)

2. **Deploy the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Railway CLI (optional but easier)
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

3. **Or use Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Select the `backend` folder
   - Railway will auto-detect Node.js

4. **Get your backend URL**:
   - After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
   - Copy this URL

5. **Update frontend to use it**:
   - Edit `frontend/js/unified-webrtc-system.js`
   - Find line 61: `const deployedBackendURL = 'https://your-backend-server.com';`
   - Replace with: `const deployedBackendURL = 'https://your-app-name.railway.app';`

6. **Deploy frontend**:
   - Your frontend is already on GitHub Pages, just push the changes

## Option 2: Deploy to Heroku

### Steps:

1. **Install Heroku CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   # Download from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
   
   # Or use npm
   npm install -g heroku
   ```

2. **Login to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

3. **Create the app**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

5. **Get your backend URL**:
   - Heroku gives you: `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`
   - Update the frontend with this URL

---

## Option 3: Deploy to Render (Free Tier)

### Steps:

1. **Sign up**: https://render.com/

2. **Create a new Web Service**:
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Select the `backend` folder
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `node server.js`

3. **Get your backend URL**: `https://your-app.onrender.com`
   - Update the frontend with this URL

## Option 4: Self-Host with a VPS

If you have a VPS or server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Then update the frontend URL to point to your server.

---

## Testing Locally First

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001

# In another terminal
# Open two browser windows to http://localhost:3001
# Both should see "Looking for someone..."
# They should match with each other!
```

---

## Important Notes

### CORS Configuration
The backend's `server.js` has CORS settings that only allow specific origins. Update line 18 in `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
const io = socketIo(server, {
    cors: {
        origin: [
            "http://localhost:3000", 
            "http://localhost:8080", 
            "https://amitkumar262002.github.io",  // Add your GitHub Pages URL
            "https://your-deployed-backend.com"     // Add your deployed backend URL
        ],
        methods: ["GET", "POST"],
        credentials: true
    },
    transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
});
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://amitkumar262002.github.io
```

## Quick Commands

### Railway
```bash
railway login
railway init
railway up
railway domain  # Get your URL
```

### Heroku
```bash
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
heroku open  # Open your app
```

### Render
- Use the dashboard to deploy
- It's mostly automated

---

## After Deployment

1. âœ… Backend is running and accessible
2. âœ… Frontend is updated with backend URL
3. âœ… CORS is configured correctly
4. âœ… Push changes to GitHub
5. âœ… Test with two browser windows - should connect real users!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Demo Mode" still showing:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend URL is correct
- Check CORS settings
- Make sure backend is actually running

### Can't connect to backend:
- Check firewall settings
- Verify backend is running: `curl https://your-backend-url.com/api/health`
- Check logs on your hosting platform

### Two users not matching:
- Make sure both users are on the same backend
- Check backend logs for connection attempts
- Try refreshing both pages

---

## Next Steps

Once your backend is deployed:
1. Update the frontend with the new backend URL
2. Push to GitHub
3. Test with two browser windows
4. Share your app - now real users can connect!

Good luck! ðŸš€
